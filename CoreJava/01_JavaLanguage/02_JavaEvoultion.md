**Java History in Key Points:**

- **Conceived by**: James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in 1991.
- **Development Timeline**: It took 18 months to develop the first working version.
- **Original Name**: Initially called "Oak," it was renamed "Java" in 1995.
- **Key Contributors**: Bill Joy, Arthur van Hoff, Jonathan Payne, Frank Yellin, and Tim Lindholm played significant roles in the evolution of Java.
- **Original Motivation**: The primary goal was to create a platform-independent language for embedding software in consumer electronic devices (e.g., microwave ovens, remote controls).
- **Problem with Existing Languages**: Languages like C and C++ were target-specific, requiring expensive and time-consuming compilers for each CPU type.
- **Solution**: Java was developed as a portable, architecture-neutral language that could run on multiple CPUs and platforms without needing a separate compiler for each.
- **Result**: Java became a powerful, platform-independent language, ultimately evolving into the widely-used programming language we know today.

**Java's Evolution and Emergence with the Web**

- **Initial Motivation**: Java was originally conceived for creating platform-independent software for consumer electronics, such as remote controls and microwave ovens.
  
- **The Impact of the Web**: The World Wide Web, emerging around the same time as Java's development, became a pivotal factor in Java's success. As the Web grew, the demand for portable programs became crucial, especially in the diverse, distributed computing environment of the Internet.

- **Portability as a Necessity**: Prior to the Web, creating portable programs was seen as an elusive but desirable goal. However, the proliferation of different computing platforms (Intel, Macintosh, UNIX) reduced the urgency. The Web changed this, as it required software that could run across all types of systems connected to the Internet.

- **From Embedded Controllers to Internet Programming**: By 1993, Java's design team recognized that the portability issues faced in creating software for embedded devices were identical to those encountered in Internet programming. This led Java to shift its focus from consumer electronics to Internet applications, paving the way for Java's large-scale success.

- **Java's Design Influence**: Java shares much of its syntax and object-oriented features with C and C++ to appeal to programmers familiar with these languages. However, despite these similarities, Java was not an enhanced version of C++ but was designed to solve a different set of problems.

- **Professional Programmer’s Language**: Java was created by real-world programmers, with a focus on providing full control to the programmer. While it shares some traits with C++, it is a cohesive and logically consistent language intended for professional use.

- **Java's Philosophical Differences from C++**: While influenced by C++, Java was not intended to replace it. C++ and Java serve different purposes and both continue to coexist. Java introduced improvements in object-oriented programming, integrated multithreading, and simplified Internet access.

- **Java’s Revolutionary Role**: Java was a revolutionary force for Internet programming, much like C was for system programming. It responded perfectly to the emerging demands of distributed computing, and its ability to run on various platforms made it a key language for the Web.
