Java is one of the most widely used and influential programming languages in the world, known for its adaptability and long-standing relevance in software development. Since its inception, Java has continually evolved to meet the needs of modern programming, especially in web development. This language's ability to stay at the forefront of innovation has made it a critical component in many of today’s applications.


- **Created by**: James Gosling  
- **Developer**: Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010)  
- **First appeared**: May 23, 1995  
- **Paradigm**: Multi-paradigm (generic, object-oriented (class-based), functional, imperative, reflective, concurrent)

  
## Key Points:

- **Global Usage**: Java remains a leading programming language worldwide, with applications spanning from mobile devices to large-scale enterprise systems.
- **Web Development**: Java became a leader in internet programming from its first release and continues to be a top choice for developing web-based applications.
- **Agility and Adaptability**: Java has evolved to keep up with the fast-paced changes in technology, continually enhancing its features

- **Java SE 8 Features**: 
  - Introduction of **lambda expressions**, boosting the language’s expressive power.
  - The **stream library** in `java.util.stream`, enabling efficient data processing.
  - **Default methods** in interfaces, allowing additional functionality without breaking existing code.
  - New features like **repeating annotations** and **type annotations** for enhanced flexibility.
- **JavaFX**: A new GUI framework for Java, offering more modern options for building graphical user interfaces. It is expected to play a significant role in Java application development moving forward.
- **Swing**: While JavaFX is the future of Java GUI frameworks, **Swing** remains widely used, and its features, such as menus, are still relevant for many applications.
  
This evolution is reflected in the continued updates of resources like this book, now in its Ninth edition, which covers the latest advancements and features in Java programming.
